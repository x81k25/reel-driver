# experimental design

## problem formulation

For the initial version of this model I am going with a binomial classifier, largely because that is the type of model that will best fit my current model training data. It would be interesting to potentially try a multi-class classification problem in the future. When discussing with my wife, we have considered labeling the data as one of these possibilities: `["would-not-watch", "would watch", "would watch multiple times"]` or something analogous. This would likely decrease the probability of getting false negatives on movies we would enjoy the most by giving them their own distinct class.

## algorithm selection

### why XGBoost

XGBoost was selected as the primary algorithm due to its exceptional ability to handle the complex, non-linear patterns present in personal media preferences:

**Complex Feature Interactions**:
- Captures sophisticated relationships between multiple variables simultaneously
- Learns that high Rotten Tomatoes scores (>85%) + low IMDB vote counts (<1,000) = movies I won't enjoy
- Simultaneously learns that high RT scores + high vote counts (>50,000) = strong positive indicators
- Automatically discovers optimal feature combinations without manual engineering

**Conditional Logic for Genre Preferences**:
- Models genre-specific decision rules through tree branching
- Learns that comedies with low RT scores but high IMDB votes are often enjoyable
- Applies different thresholds for action movies and dramas (requiring both high RT scores and high vote counts)
- Creates separate decision paths for each genre's unique patterns

**Non-Linear Decision Boundaries**:
- Tree-based ensemble creates complex decision boundaries beyond linear separability
- Handles non-monotonic relationships (where more of a feature isn't always better)
- Separates movies I'd enjoy from those I wouldn't across multiple interacting dimensions
- Captures threshold effects and interaction terms naturally

**Language Preference Modeling**:
- Learns general preference for English-language films
- Creates exceptions for highly-rated foreign films meeting specific criteria
- Models conditional logic: IF language â  English AND RT score >90% AND IMDB votes >100,000 THEN predict positive
- Balances general rules with nuanced exceptions

**Second-Order Optimization**:
- Uses both first and second derivatives in optimization: `L^(t) = Î£[l(y_i, Å·_i^(t-1)) + g_i*f_t(x_i) + (1/2)*h_i*f_tÂ²(x_i)] + Î©(f_t)`
- Newton's method approach provides faster convergence than first-order methods
- Better handling of complex loss landscapes created by conflicting preference signals
- More stable learning when dealing with contradictory patterns in the data

**Automatic Regularization**:
- Built-in L1/L2 regularization prevents overfitting to personal quirks
- Tree pruning removes splits that don't meaningfully improve predictions
- Crucial for learning genuine patterns from limited personal training data
- Balances model complexity with generalization ability

### other models that would likely underperform

**Linear Models**:
- Completely fail to capture non-linear interactions and conditional preferences
- Cannot model scenarios where the same feature (e.g., RT score) can be both positive and negative depending on other feature values
- Miss critical threshold effects and genre-specific patterns
- Assume monotonic relationships that don't exist in personal preferences

**Logistic Regression**:
- Even with polynomial features, struggles with high-dimensional interaction space
- Requires extensive manual feature engineering to capture genre-specific rules
- Cannot efficiently model multi-way interactions between ratings, votes, and genres
- Poor handling of categorical variables like genre combinations

**Naive Bayes**:
- Strong independence assumption misses critical feature interactions
- Cannot capture the relationship between ratings and vote counts across different genres
- Fails to model conditional dependencies that drive movie preferences
- Treats each feature as independent when they clearly interact

**K-Nearest Neighbors**:
- Sensitive to curse of dimensionality with metadata features
- Doesn't generalize well to new movies with feature combinations not in training data
- No explicit model of preference patterns, just memorizes similar examples
- Poor performance with mixed categorical and continuous features

### other options that might work well

**Random Forest**:
- Strong alternative that captures non-linear relationships and feature interactions
- Provides good baseline performance with minimal tuning required
- However, XGBoost typically outperforms due to sequential error correction approach
- Less sophisticated optimization compared to gradient boosting methods

**CatBoost**:
- Another gradient boosting variant with native categorical feature handling
- Could potentially perform similarly to XGBoost on movie metadata
- Excellent with categorical features like genres and languages
- May require less preprocessing for categorical variables

**LightGBM**:
- Faster gradient boosting implementation with similar theoretical foundation
- Might achieve comparable performance with significantly reduced training time
- Potentially at the cost of some accuracy on smaller datasets like personal preferences
- Good alternative for rapid experimentation and iteration

**Neural Networks (Tabular)**:
- Modern architectures like TabNet could potentially learn complex patterns
- Deep networks might capture subtle interactions in movie preferences
- Would likely require significantly more training data than available
- Less interpretability for understanding specific preference patterns
- Overkill for structured tabular data of this size

**Support Vector Machines with RBF Kernel**:
- Could capture non-linear relationships through kernel trick
- Struggles with mixed categorical/continuous nature of movie metadata
- Doesn't provide interpretability benefits of tree-based models
- Less effective at handling the high-dimensional feature space after encoding

## model hyperparameters

### class imbalance control

Class imbalance is the primary challenge with a 10:1 negative-to-positive ratio. `scale_pos_weight` directly addresses this by weighting positive examples more heavily during training. `min_child_weight` prevents unreliable predictions from small positive sample sizes by requiring sufficient instance weight in leaf nodes. `max_delta_step` provides additional imbalance protection by limiting how dramatically any single tree can adjust predictions.

### Bias vs Variance Trade-off (High Impact)

Managing model complexity involves balancing bias (underfitting) against variance (overfitting) through multiple mechanisms. `max_depth` controls how many questions each tree can ask - deeper trees capture complex interactions but risk memorizing noise. `n_estimators` sets the number of expert voters, with more trees typically improving performance until diminishing returns. `learning_rate` moderates learning aggression, requiring more trees at lower rates but achieving more stable convergence.

Regularization techniques prevent overfitting while maintaining model capacity. gamma enforces conservative tree-building by requiring meaningful loss reduction before adding complexity. `reg_alpha` applies L1 penalties that push weak feature weights toward zero, automatically removing irrelevant features. `subsample` trains each tree on random data subsets, forcing generalization while reducing computational load. `colsample_bytree` and `colsample_bylevel` add feature randomization layers that prevent overreliance on specific features. `min_child_weight` prevents unreliable predictions from small sample sizes. 

### computational efficiency vs performance

Training speed trades off with model quality primarily through `n_estimators` and `learning_rate`. More estimators with lower learning rates improve performance but extend training time. `subsample` reduces computational load by training each tree on a random data subset while providing regularization benefits that prevent overfitting.

### feature selection and regularization

Automatic feature selection occurs through multiple mechanisms. `reg_alpha` applies L1 penalties that push weak feature weights toward zero, effectively removing irrelevant features. `colsample_bytree` creates feature specialists by limiting each tree to a random feature subset. `colsample_bylevel` adds another randomization layer within tree levels for additional regularization. `enable_categorical` optimizes categorical feature handling without requiring manual tuning.

## model training and tuning

## model evaluation metrics   

I usually lean towards f1 score as my go-to performance metric, because it presents such a reliable overall metric of model performance, but we have some additional layers here. Given the imbalanced nature of the data (roughly 10:1 negatives vs positives), average_precision would be a very good metric to use as it is my favorite for accounting for imbalanced data sets.

But, lets talk about how I actually intend to use the model here. In my production workflow I will be using this model's probability output rather than the binary prediction output. And I am going to set the threshold below 50%. Practically speaking I want to see the edge cases, and the elements just below it. I will manually retrain those elements and (in a future state) configure the automatic-transmission to delete elements upon retraining. I am also going to manually retrain false negatives by manually adding media items. So, with the practical implications in mind, false negatives actually have a much greater weight and therefore the performance metric to be used will be recall.   

| Metric | Definition | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------------|------|------|
| recall | TP / (TP + FN) | Minimizes missing good movies; aligns with 35% threshold strategy | Ignores false positives; can flood your library |
| average_precision | Area under precision-recall curve | Optimizes across all thresholds; good for threshold tuning | Less directly tied to your manual curation workflow |
| f1 | Harmonic mean of precision and recall | Balances missing movies vs manual cleanup work | Fixed threshold assumption doesn't match your flexible approach |
| balanced_accuracy | (TPR + TNR) / 2 | Accounts for class imbalance | Doesn't prioritize recall over precision for your use case |
| precision | TP / (TP + FP) | Minimizes manual deletion work | Conflicts with goal of catching edge cases at 35% threshold |
| roc_auc | Area under ROC curve | Threshold-independent | Poor with imbalance; doesn't align with your workflow priorities |
| neg_log_loss | Negative log-likelihood | Good probability calibration for threshold setting | Hard to interpret; doesn't directly measure workflow efficiency |
| accuracy | (TP + TN) / Total | Simple to understand | Completely misleading given your manual curation process |
